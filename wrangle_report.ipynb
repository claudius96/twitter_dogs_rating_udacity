    "From the gathering process I assessed these datasets. I was able to find couple number of problems in the dataset which include misrepresented data types, rating denominators below and above 10 whilst they're supposed to 10, I noticed tidness issues where variable is to form a column but 1 variable had formed many columns.\n",
